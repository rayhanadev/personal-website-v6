<Link href="https://www.deel.com/">deel</Link> is a payroll and compliance provider
for remote teams. in september of 2022, i worked as a freelance web developer for deel,
where i built an internal tool that integrated with their elasticsearch instance to
provide a search interface for their customer support team. i worked with pure html, css,
and javascript on the frontend and express.js on the backend to build a fast and responsive
search tool that allowed the team to quickly find relevant search results, which was
eventually built into their own site.
