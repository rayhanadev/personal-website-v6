magicprints is an e-commerce startup that used generative ai to design and sell custom apparel. from october 2022
to december 2022, i was a founding engineer for magicprints, where i built the initial version of the website,
including the product builder, shopping cart, and checkout flow, and integrated with print-on-demand services to
fulfill orders. i worked with early generative ai models to design the image generation and reiteration pipelines
and i created novel user interfaces allowing users to effectively interact with the ai.
