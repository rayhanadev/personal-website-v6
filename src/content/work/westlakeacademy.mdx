is an ib world school based in westlake, texas known for being one of the
top charter schools in the united states. i was a teaching assistant for
the ib computer science course from august 2022 to april 2024 and ib history
course from august 2023 to april 2024.

in my time as a teaching assistant, i helped develop students skills in
computer science and history using my own experiences from the
professional world and my passion for teaching. when a subject came up
that i was excited about, i would often be given the lesson plans and
encouraged to teach the lesson in my style. i worked with small groups
of students to grow their knowledge beyond the requirements of the
course and i prepared them for careers in the real world. i also
developed deep connections with the students and helped them with their
personal and life goals.
